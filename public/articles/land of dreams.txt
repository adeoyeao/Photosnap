<p>Wolves!” yelled our guide, gesticulating at some tiny spots of grey flecking a distant beach before downing his binoculars, gunning the powerful twin outboard engines of the Zodiac and sending up a thick plume of spray as we scudded across the waves towards the shore. Driven by early-morning hunger, the wolves were gorging themselves on crabs exposed by the falling tide, but as suddenly as they had appeared – and before we had drawn close enough to focus a camera – they sniffed the air and slunk back into the shadows of the Canadian rainforest.

</p><p>“Wow!” said my teenage son, Joe. “Not bad,” said his twin sister, Anna, almost forgetting to retain her indifference. A few days into our “last ever” family holiday, it was exactly the reaction we had wanted.

</p><p>Such enthusiasm, if I can call it that, had been a long time coming. As they’d turned 16, the twins had made it abundantly clear that they had no desire to go on any kind of holiday with their “boring” parents. Acknowledging that a fortnight in a Cornish cottage without friends or Wi-Fi would have been a disaster, my wife and I began to consider what kind of holiday they would enjoy.

</p><p>Our research led us to British Columbia, where enticements for the active included ziplining through remote canyons, kayaking around deserted islands in search of bears and wolves, surfing and hiking through rainforest. To appeal to the twins’ urban souls, we decided to bookend the Great Outdoors with a few nights in Vancouver, consistently voted one of the top five cities worldwide for quality of life. Its combination of culture (notably film, but also art, museums, music and nightlife), city beaches and world-leading cuisine would prove irresistible to our townie sophisticates.

</p><p>So confident were we of our choice, we went ahead and booked, then waited until GCSEs were over to announce the trip of a lifetime. The children’s reaction shocked us. They refused outright to join us on “another bloody family outing”. After paying dearly for airline tickets, a rental car, hotels, a ferry passage to Vancouver Island and a bucket list to tempt surely the most world-weary teenager, we had a full-scale mutiny on our hands. “I wanted to go into London with my friends,” stormed Joe. “If you think I’m sitting in a boring boat just so you can see an otter, forget it,” protested Anna. “Why don’t you go on your own?”

</p><p>Just days before our flight, it was Joe who capitulated first, aware that his friends were melting away on their own family holidays. “Will the hotels have Wi-Fi?” he asked. When I answered yes, it was a done deal – and Anna reluctantly surrendered.

</p><p>Fast forward to our flight landing in Vancouver, and the pair could scarcely conceal their excitement. Perhaps it was just relief after the torpor of a nine-hour flight, but they both described the city, sparkling in the coastal sunlight below, as “sensational”.

</p><p>Once on terra firma, the old cynicism returned. On the 30-minute taxi ride into the city, we pointed out elegant residential villas, glittering skyscrapers and a procession of vintage seaplanes taking off from the harbour. “It’s just scenery,” the twins informed us.

</p><p>Their mood began to thaw in our room at the harbourfront Pan Pacific Hotel, where discovering the Wi-Fi password put them back in touch with London. Next day, as we set out to explore Vancouver, they found themselves reluctantly agreeing that the city is intoxicating. We lost track of time as we wandered through public squares with fantastic water features and witty sculptures. We breezed through hip, Victorian-era Gastown with its buzzing boutiques and coffee houses, our only concern being that, after all the urban buzz, wild Vancouver Island might fall a bit flat.

</p><p>As exam stress slipped away, the twins’ mood lifted and we felt even more reluctant to leave Vancouver. Strolling along its beachfront boardwalk, we remarked on how it seemed like an advert for healthy living as its citizens enjoyed rollerblading, jogging and cycling. Hiring bikes ourselves, we whizzed through semi-wild Stanley Park on a guided tour, marvelling at First Nation totem poles, giant cedars, raccoons and a beaver lodge – all within walking distance of our hotel. Exhausted, we refuelled at the Glowbal Restaurant, which bills itself as “unapologetically chaotic” and serves spicy “stripped-down North American cuisine”.

</p><p>The wrench of leaving this waterfront idyll was softened by our luxurious rental 4x4 – a Ford Explorer. After a civilised 1hr 40min ferry crossing from Horseshoe Bay to Nanaimo, we penetrated deep into what felt like Jurassic Park. Just 30 nautical miles offshore and a third again bigger than Wales, Vancouver Island is an adventurer’s playground of shimmering lakes, craggy fjords, mountains and rugged Pacific coastline lashed by surf. There are beauty spots around every corner, and the pristine rainforest is dark, deep and dangerous enough to conceal wolves, elks, marmots, black bears and North America’s greatest concentration of cougars.

</p><p>It was an hour into our journey, at isolated Cathedral Grove – a forest of Douglas firs, some 230ft tall and 6ft thick – that we felt we had won our children back. Together we gazed in awe through the ancient canopy, then paused at Port Alberni, a cheery lakeside lumber and fishing city, where Anna entertained the locals with an open-air recital on a piano in the sunny town square. The entire audience applauded.

</p><p>After negotiating the vertiginous Pacific Rim Highway, we rolled into the laid-back small town of Ucluelet – or “Ukee” as it is known locally – and checked into a chic cabin at the remote Terrace Beach, perched in the cedar treetops high above the sand. This was nature at its very best.

</p><p>Now with their own bedrooms (we had shared in Vancouver to cut costs), Joseph and Anna were in full-on holiday mood.

</p><p>Next day, we headed for Long Beach – at 10 miles long, true to its name – for a surfing lesson at Surf Sisters, where all the instructors are women. Anna and Joe were showcasing their stand-up skills within minutes, their reward being lunch at the adjacent Surfside Grill. The salmon burgers were made with fish pulled from the ocean that very morning by chef and owner Jeff Mikus.

</p><p>At Schooner Bay, on the road back to Ukee, we paused to hike along a twisting rainforest boardwalk – and stopped dead in our tracks. A large sign warned, in capital letters where deemed necessary: “WOLF ADVISORY IN EFFECT. If you see a wolf DO NOT RUN, DO NOT CROUCH DOWN, PICK UP SMALL CHILDREN.” Undeterred by the final warning – “IF A WOLF APPROACHES YOU, THROW STICKS AND STONES ETC; IF THE AGGRESSION ESCALATES, FIGHT BACK” – our twins romped ahead along the forest trail.

</p><p>The wildlife remained well hidden, allowing me to click away with the camera as Anna and Joe played on the shoreline, becoming once again the children we had taken on holiday so many times before.

</p><p>Later in the week, we rode the West Coast Zipline, whizzing through canyons and high above waterfalls deep in First Nation territory. In Ukee, we got to know the town’s many cafés and restaurants.

</p><p>Which brings us back to that distant wolf sighting. Hoping for closer encounters, we strapped ourselves into kayaks at dawn the next day and, under sunny skies, paddled out into the vast stillness of Stuart Bay to pick up starfish and glide past sea lions.

</p><p>As we turned for home, a huge black bear lumbered on to the foreshore just feet from our kayaks. Awestruck, and struck silent, we stared at him – and he stared back. He turned over a few large rocks, hungrily hoovered up some crabs and, after 10 electrifying minutes, disappeared into the woods. It was a family moment none of us will forget.

</p><p>Back in Vancouver, there was one last treat – a 40-minute flight in a Fifties seaplane. It felt like we were in Raiders of the Lost Ark as we bounced across the choppy harbour, engines droning, propellers grappling for air, and then we were airborne. Soaring close to the skyscrapers, our unified family enjoyed a last, bittersweet close-up of the city with its unforgettable skyline, sparkling marinas, winding boardwalk and sprawling green parks yielding to the craggy, snow-covered mountains beyond.

</p><p>“Can we come back next year?” demanded Anna and Joe. How things change.</p>
