<p>Seemingly everyone has a motorbike story from Southeast Asia; it’s almost a rite-of-passage when traveling in SEA.

</p><p>I’d been traveling for almost a year at this point. When you’re backpacking, you tend to meet lots of other long-term backpackers, but in Cambodia, perhaps a little lonely, I latched onto two other solo travelers—a guy and a girl, both from the UK.

</p><p>We became fast friends and spent weeks traveling Cambodia (and eventually Vietnam) together. And perhaps because they were each a few years younger than me, or maybe it was because they were British, we seemed to have one crazy, chaotic experience together for nearly a month.

</p><p>In the riverside city of Kampot, where we spent a week eating junk food and getting high, we did manage to do some sightseeing. A nearby national park came recommended by every guidebook we found ourselves flipping through while lounging by the river each day, so one day we packed up some picnic supplies, rented motorbikes, and made our way up the mountain.

</p><p>Driving (sober) through the fog, we found an abandoned, run-down church, where we hung out for a few hours, telling spooky ghost stories, and taking ridiculous photos. Later that day, on the way down the mountain, somehow, we managed to break one of the motorbikes, though.

</p><p>Maybe it was a flat tire? Or maybe we ran out of fuel? Or maybe we just didn’t know how to drive safely on a bike, and the strange misty weather made it that much more challenging. Stranded on the side of mountain, on a little-traveled road, hungry and without water and unsure how to continue the journey, we waited for what seemed like ages for a passing car.

</p><p>Eventually, we were able to hitch a ride in the back of a passing pick-up truck. Not speaking the language and with total strangers, we made our way back into town, abandoned the motorbike at a garage, and then headed back to our riverside bungalow.

</p><p>Our day of adventure could have turned out much differently if we weren’t resourceful, and thankfully the motorbike broke down before any of us were injured, but it was a stressful travel day. The kind of day you’re thankful you’ve got insurance in case anything worse would have happened.</p>
