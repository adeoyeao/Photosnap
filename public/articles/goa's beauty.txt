<p>We decided, on the drive from the airport to our hotel, to play a game of “count the hippy”. There had been just one on our short flight from Mumbai to Goa, among the elegant pensioners and twentysomethings who looked as if they had just walked off the set of Made in Chelsea. Even he had a freshly scrubbed look about him, and a pair of designer shorts.

</p><p>It would be five days until we spotted a proper hippy, a man with a tan as deep as his beard was white, who sat at the side of the road manning a shack selling soft drinks. After that, our only hippy encounter was on a beachside walk past a topless Westerner playing bongos and chanting, a scene that might have made a few men feel spiritual but which was sadly lost on me.

</p><p>There had been a large amount of eye-rolling when I told friends I was going to Goa, a place synonymous with society dropouts and backpackers who want to spend their days getting high on glorious beaches while listening to Goan trance. “The best way to find your inner self,” said one man who had visited the former Portuguese colony, “is to eat an undercooked chicken korma. Then it will all be laid out in front of you.” How we tittered.

</p><p>But Goa has long been a staple of the hippy trail. It became India’s 25th state in 1961, the last place on the subcontinent to shake off outside rule, and yet the vibe has remained steadfastly European ever since. Only recently Bob Geldof recalled at a festival in Goa that, when he was a teenager, he saw the place as “a land of drugs, beaches and women who would s--- you”. The Goan tourist authority got very cross, and insisted that much had changed since Geldof was a boy.

</p><p>And I had heard about a new Goa, a chic Goa, one that involved culture and luxury instead of beach shacks and bongos, one that Hollywood A-listers such as Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had travelled to, and all the new rich Russians loved thanks to its warmth and its relative proximity to Moscow. My friend Holly and I were far more determined to find that Goa than we were our inner selves.

</p><p>Still, at the dusty airport, delirious after almost 24 hours with no sleep and a six-hour wait in the dead of night in Mumbai’s dreary domestic terminal, I struggled to see how we would discover either.

</p><p>Arriving at our hotel, shepherded through the airport-style security that has been a feature of Indian tourism since the Mumbai terrorist attacks of 2008, I wondered if we had got our destination wrong. Then I saw the pool, a vast infinity number that spilt into a paddy field, and all worries evaporated (hard not to in the heat).

</p><p>It is the selling point of the Alila Diwa, one of the many plush resorts that have popped up in southern Goa, away from the hippies who are said to stalk the north of the state.

</p><p>Actually, it was one of the many selling points of the Alila Diwa, but let me catch my breath. The other ones were: it’s as swish as it is reasonably priced; the giant beds and baths; the four different restaurants; the fact that it was really quite big and yet felt ridiculously intimate. Also there’s the lovely detail of being contacted by staff before you’ve even left your home in Britain to ask what kind of fruit you want, the pillow you’d like, and whether you want to surprise your loved one with a romantic dinner (while I do love Holly, I decided not to treat her to this).

</p><p>I liked the staff, most of whom are from the local village of Majorda, because they weren’t too fawning or overattentive – such as the in-house yoga teacher, who told me that I needed to “pull” my “weight down”. He was no-nonsense and fun and I saw him every day we were there. A week with him was about the price of a two-hour yoga class in central London, and a whole lot better. Ditto the treatments in the spa, where they used fresh, natural, local ingredients to exfoliate and pummel. I went there every day, too, sometimes twice.

</p><p>Holly thought this was a bit indulgent, so instead she took advantage of the option to accompany the senior chef, Eida, to the market, where they bought fish and later cooked it together for our dinner. She was very keen to let it be known that this was not her very own surprise romantic dinner, but a way to acquire cooking skills with which to impress her new boyfriend.

</p><p>While I spent my days reading and being massaged, Holly continued to look for adventures, all of which were organised by the smiling Alila staff. She went to a spice plantation and came back stinking of cardamom and nutmeg and cinnamon, and raving about the smell of split-in-half vanilla pods. Then she gallivanted off to Old Goa, returning with tales of Catholic churches and Hindu temples and a city abandoned in the 16th century due to outbreaks of plague and cholera. It sounded terribly romantic, but I had another massage appointment to get to. Holly sighed.

</p><p>I had to accept that a pool overlooking a paddy field was no substitute for seeing the real Goa, however lovely it might have been. Also, I was getting a bit sick of the sight of glamorous Russian women in teeny bikinis, who had a habit of parading in front of the paddy field. It was time to move on. We were going – gasp! – north, to where the hippies supposedly were. Would we find any?

</p><p>Our destination was a place called Elsewhere, though we were unsure as to where Elsewhere was, exactly. Somewhere on Mandrem beach, apparently, but precious little other information was given to us when we called ahead to book one of its beach houses for a few days. Owned by the fashion photographer Denzel Sequeira, who hails from Mumbai, Elsewhere has been in his family since 1886, when his great-grandfather, Anjelo Zeferino Sequeira, bought 80,000 sq ft of land on a beach wedged between a creek and the Arabian Sea. Since then, four magnificent Portuguese beach houses have been built, and Denzel has added three large, luxurious tents overlooking the creek. Elsewhere is now an idyllic escape for those in the know, never advertised and no address given.

</p><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are said to have stayed here, attracted by both its remoteness and its discretion. Barbara, a former Pan Am air hostess who now runs the joint with Denzel, told us where to take a taxi to. At our allotted point, on a dirty coastal road, we were met by a young man bearing a sign that read “Take Me Elsewhere”. He did.

</p><p>We walked to the edge of the creek, where we crossed a rickety bamboo bridge that could have come straight from an Indiana Jones movie. On the other side there were coconut trees and there was beach – oodles of it. Barbara took us to the “dining shack” – a giant canvas awning, where we sat on antique furniture and pushed our toes around in the sand. She ordered us freshly made omelettes from the kitchen and, as we waited, we chose books from the library (a set of shelves) and listened to her tales of turtles hatching on the beach. Even before we got to our beach house, we felt as if we were in heaven.

</p><p>The omelettes were fluffy and worth the wait (indeed, all the food – made from scratch with only local ingredients – was worth waiting for). The five-minute walk to the house took us past pine trees and the bones of a whale that had washed up on the beach a few years previously. Once we got to the Bakery – you can also stay in the Piggery or the Priest’s House – we almost cried. It was basic but beautiful, all whitewashed walls and guidebooks detailing the local wildlife. We sat on our porch drinking local beer and watching a kingfisher flutter around a hammock before the sun went down.

</p><p>In the distance, we could just about make out the thump of trance music from a bar. There were hippies nearby, we were sure of it, but they could have been on a different planet for all we cared.</p>
